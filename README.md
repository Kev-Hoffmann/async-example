# Challenge
Create an application that fetches data asynchronously from two endpoints 
and displays the merged response as JSON response from an REST API.

Example endpoints:

http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1

http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1

# Solution

My solution for this challenge is to create a Spring Boot application using Spring Webflux to handle the asynchronous requests.

- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Webflux
- Mockito
- WireMock
